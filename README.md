# shortestPath-Floyd
I am a student major in electronic information. I have been learning programming for several years.
After a classmate told me about the benifits of using Github, I searched on the Internet about what Github is and how to use it. This repository is my first atempt to use it.
Recently, I'm learning about data structure and algorithm. So, I decided to create a repository about how to calculate the shortest path with Floyd Algorithm.
